# Easy Linux Control Script

## Description
I developed a Bash menu-based script to help beginner Linux users perform common system control and troubleshooting tasks easily.  
This project focuses on solving everyday command-line problems by providing a simple and interactive menu interface.

## Features
- System summary (user, uptime, disk, memory)
- Find biggest files in current directory
- Search text inside files
- Create backups (tar.gz)
- Change file permissions
- Search running processes
- Kill a process by PID (with confirmation)

## Run
```bash
chmod +x easy_control.sh
./easy_control.sh
